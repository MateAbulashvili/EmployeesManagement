Welcome to my project! This is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that leverages Entity Framework and MSSQL to perform CRUD operations. To ensure security, 
I have implemented JWT for user authentication and authorization. In the development process, I have followed SOLID principles to ensure a maintainable 
and scalable codebase. Additionally, this project adheres to RESTful principles to provide a seamless user experience.
Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, and MSSQL.
Feel free to browse the code and provide any feedback you may have.
